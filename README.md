# dl-biodb
Repo for work surrounding downloadable biological databases

## Purpose

There are loads of issues surrounding how to organize how to download 
database, and where databases should live once downloaded. This repo 
is meant as a place to discuss things (see issues), and as a place to 
gather solutions (see wiki once we've settled on things).
